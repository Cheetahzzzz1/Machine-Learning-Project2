# Machine Learning Project 2

# Overview

This project aims on building and evaluating two types of neural networks to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset:

 1. Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)

 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

The goal is to achieve a higher testing accuracy (>95%) using both models and analyse thier performance over multiple training runs.
